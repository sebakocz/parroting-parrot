## :heart: Credits

### üëè Special Thanks

* to DeadZ0n and Monsterland for excessive and blunt quality assurance
* to Lovepon, Magneter and Grief for moral support

### ü§ì Info for nerds

* While on the surface this is a simple bot I learned neat things about CI/CD - used tools include supervisor, github actions, pre-commit hooks and auto linting
* I didn't work on this project _alone_, my loyal friend [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) was helping out too
* I might start dev-blogging soon‚Ñ¢
